# Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains code and data files for predicting customer churn using machine learning models. Churn prediction is crucial for businesses to understand and potentially mitigate customer attrition.

# Dataset:
- The dataset used in this project is `Churn_Modelling.csv`, which contains information about bank customers including demographics, usage patterns, and whether they exited the bank (churned).

# Models Implemented:
- Logistic Regression: Implemented logistic regression for churn prediction. Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Random Forest: Utilized a random forest classifier for churn prediction. Assessed model performance metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): Implemented XGBoost classifier for improved prediction performance. Evaluated the model's accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

# Performance Comparison:
- Compared the performance of logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models.
- Plotted a bar chart to visualize and compare accuracies of each model.

# How to Use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to train and evaluate models.
4. Modify the code as needed for your own datasets or additional experimentation.

# Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost
